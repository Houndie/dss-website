<Layout title="Safety">
	<p>Dayton Swing Smackdown is committed to providing a safe place for all attendees to dance and enjoy themselves.  To that end, we rely on all guests to obey a code of conduct to make the experience the best it can be for everyone.  Guests who disobey the code of conduct may be given warnings, or barred entry to portions or the entirety of the event.</p>
	<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Dayton Swing Smackdown is open to all people, regardless of orientation, identity, race, appearance or religion.  No attendees should use language deemed discriminatory towards any person or group of people</li>
		<li>Attendees at Dayton Smackdown are allowed to say “no” to dance for any reason</li>
		<li>Do not attempt to teach or give advice to any other attendee, unless they ask for it.</li>
		<li>Harassment of any kind is strictly prohibited.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Report a Violation</h3>
	<p>If any attendee feels there is a violation of the code of conduct, feels unsafe or harassed, or has any other safety concerns, they are encouraged to report it!  Please bring any concerns to a Dayton Swing Smackdown staff member.  If you don’t feel comfortable talking to a staff member, send us an email at <a href="mailto:safety@daytonswingsmackdown.com">safety@daytonswingsmackdown.com</a>.</p>
	<h2>Covid</h2>
	<p>This year, Dayton Swing Smackdown has no specific covid policy.  We still strongly encourage attendees to get the most up to date vaccines.  Masks are also optional, but encouraged. We also strongly encourage all attendees to take a covid test prior to attending the event. They are inexpensive and quick, and you can easily help prevent others from getting sick.</p>
	<p>If you do get sick, please see our <a href="/pricing">refund and deferral policy</a>.</p>
