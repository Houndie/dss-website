	<h2>Refunds, Deferrals, and Transfers</h2>
	<p>If you are unable to attend the event, we are happy to facilitate pass transfers or deferrals. Passes can be transferred by changing the name on the registration via the link in your confirmation email. If you experience trouble or want to defer your pass to a future year, we will be happy to assist at <a href="mailto:info@daytonswingsmackdown.com">info@daytonswingsmackdown.com</a>.</p>
	<p>While we prefer you attempt to defer or transfer your pass instead of requesting a refund (as pass refunds come at a cost to us from our payment processors), we are also happy to assist with refunds if no other option is available.  Simply email us at the above address and we will assist you.</p>
	<p>Please note that this event is run by volunteers in our spare time, and it may take some time for us to respond, especially as the event approaches...but we will try and get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
